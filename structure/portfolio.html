            If you are looking to hire me for a project you are working on, this is the place where I</br>
            show off my programming skills.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            So, to get started, I am fluent in two main languages. Python, and Lua. I have been learning</br>
            both of these for around five years, so I know my stuff. I use Python for anything I upload to</br>
            GitHub, and Lua for applications using the Roblox game engine.</br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my favorite projects I have created using Python are:</br>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/mini-mp3"> A wrapper around PyTube to download YouTube videos, and convert them to any format FFmpeg supports. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/theme-manager.py"> A utility to load "themes" on Linux using Bash scripts. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/roblox-status-notifier"> A utility to notify you if a user on Roblox comes online. Has Linux and Windows support. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/QuickFolder"> A tool to open up folders on Windows when you press a keyboard combination. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/qtile-scripts/"> A collection of scripts I have created for the tiling window manager Qtile. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/datastructures-and-algorithms/tree/master/algorithms/python"> A collection of algorithms I have implemented in Python. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/spacelogger"> A small, lightweight logger. </a> </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I also have a fair bit of knowledge in C:</br>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/c-string-library"> A string library written in C. </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/datastructures-and-algorithms/tree/master/datastructures/c"> A collection of data structures implemented in C </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qODPC2c_TAk"> A file manager that is currently in progress.</a> </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I also spend a bit of time messing around on Roblox (which is most likely what you are here for.)</br>
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5oUbes4Ts"> A cool little lightbulb / lighting engine </a> </li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnkQUQTAkM4"> Experimentation with generating "planets" with Perlin Noise </a> </li>
            </ul>
