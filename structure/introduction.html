            Hello! If you are reading this, you probably want to know a ltitle bit about me. </br>
            I am a sixteen year old programmer with about five years of programming experience! </br>
            I spend most of my time programming, or talking on Discord. I really like coding in </br>
            C, and Python, but I also know a lot about the Roblox game engine and have been using </br>
            it since I was about ten years old. </br>
        </p>
        <p>
            As for what I code specifically, I spend a lot of time making command-line applications. </br>
            My current project (which is currently on hold, since I am learning C), is a command-line </br>
            Discord client called <i><b>Pycord</b></i>, which you can find various demonstrations of Here: </br>

            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVPnmaayhrQ"> Demonstration #1 </a></li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQpSc-YtwI"> Demonstration #2 </a></li>
                <li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdrsO3HhnZY"> Demonstration #3 </a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Another part of programming I really like is the editors, with my favorite being <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim"> Neovim</a>. </br>
            You can find my dotfiles for Neovim, as well as many of the other applications I use, </br>
            like Tmux <a href="https://github.com/spaceraiders0/dotfiles"> here</a>. </br></br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that is it. If you need to contact me, whether for a commision, to report a</br>
            bug in a piece of software I have written, or just to talk, shoot me a message on Discord. =)</br>
